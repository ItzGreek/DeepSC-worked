pl mr president in my contribution to the debate on the report on public finances in the emu countries for i would like to make a few observations
the commission will therefore continue to support georgia in its political social and economic development convinced that the country has the strength to overcome the challenges it faces
on behalf of the uen group  pl minister commissioner at the last moment we are breaking the eu s rather compromising silence on the matter of georgia
on behalf of the gue ngl group  cs since georgia has had three presidents the dissident gamsakhurdia the communist establishmentarian shevardnadze and recently the american protege saakashvili
it is true that russia is exploiting the situation but it is equally clear that russia s imperial interests would also find other justifications should the need arise
it madam president ladies and gentlemen over time the number of drivers who have committed traffic offences in a member state other than their own has progressively increased
so it is a good report but the important thing is that it is not left lying on a commission desk gathering dust  we should implement this
i am in favour of the directive of the european parliament and of the council facilitating the cross border exchange of information on road safety related traffic offences
only by carrying out controls of this kind can we avoid the proliferation in the member states of new dreadful epidemics that jeopardise the health of european citizens
the european union together with all the democratic institutions of the member states has an inescapable duty to guarantee public safety against a global phenomenon such as terrorism
the failure to include the risk of terrorism in the stress tests means that the profits of the nuclear power companies will be protected against costly modernisation measures
de mr president of course we can continue the debate  mr cohn bendit s motion has been carried after all and many comments have been made
president in office  sl i am delighted to be here with you in today s plenary session dedicated to the debate on the galileo implementation regulation

the mission of the eu political directors tomorrow will indeed be a very useful opportunity to confirm our wholehearted support for georgia at this very difficult juncture
es madam president i have supported this report because it is going to improve the quality of food products while also contributing to informed and responsible consumption
the digital agenda has immense potential for growth enhanced productivity and inclusion as well as more integrated information in fields such as education health and public administration
the draft regulation does not provide for the necessary flexibility within the eu budget nor does it call for supplementary funding to implement political and economic priorities
i voted against amendment to paragraph concerning the feed ban on provisions for non ruminants as i believe that there are very serious health risks for humans
the european parliament has voted to lift the ban on animal meal and is authorising its use for non herbivores in other words poultry fish and pigs
two significant factors caused the economic crisis in the eu and the decline in its global competitiveness namely excessive member state budget deficits and unfair internal competition
i would like to express my sincere gratitude for the work of our three representatives at the intergovernmental conference elmar brok enrique baron crespo and andrew duff
it is high time that the euratom treaty was revised  this situation where we have no influence over the safety of nuclear power stations cannot continue
lt madam president firstly i would like to thank you for the opportunity to discuss this important issue today particularly as regards the european union s neighbourhood
the second principle is that this control mechanism should be entrusted to an independent and impartial authority  i do not have much faith in self regulation
de since the storming of the red mosque has now been carried out should we not use the past tense at least in the second part
the list goes from mr molzer right wing radical via mr rubig a conservative right through to mr bosch chairman of the committee on budgetary control
nobody needs a second military satellite programme unless it is used for eu geostrategic and military interests  therefore galileo should simply be a civilian project

this report proposes introducing body scanners in airports in order to further reduce the risk of potential attackers successfully transporting hazardous material on board airplanes
in writing  i voted in favour of this report as it is important to consider quotas to increase female representation on boards of directors
this is why i supported the joint resolution and this is why i am in favour of supporting mr oettinger and not constantly attacking him
the next item is the report by mr lauk on behalf of the committee on economic and monetary affairs on public finances in emu
there are certain recommendations in mr lauk s report that i would like to stress and i shall add a few of my own
mr titley your complaint will be immediately passed to the office of the president with your request that they should respond to it immediately
the important thing now is that we make a very clear assessment of the situation in abkhazia and offer our unambiguous support to georgia
but of course we will continue to be active because this is one of the things that we must constantly keep our eyes on
it madam president ladies and gentlemen today s vote ends an incredible work cycle that has seen more than amendments tabled in three years

i am convinced that this recommendation will help boost the competitiveness of agri food enterprises insofar as it will guarantee total uniformity of rules
today we voted during the plenary session of the european parliament in strasbourg on the report on the multiannual financial framework for the years
fr mr president like egnos the galileo programme symbolises the spirit of europe to join forces so that together we can go further
however the report itself simultaneously provides for the use of data whenever necessary giving a vague and unclear idea of its true objectives
the new data protection regime should reduce bureaucratic and financial burdens and carefully assess the application of several rules relating to small enterprises
in the report on the commission work programme for the next year there are several points that in my view are absolutely unfavourable
the next item is the commission statement on stress tests of nuclear power plants in eu and nuclear safety in eu neighbouring countries
in today s plenary session of parliament in strasbourg we voted on the report on european broadband investing in digitally driven growth
the fight against agro piracy has now been tightened further and the protection of agri food production has taken a step forward
we have therefore voted against this report to reaffirm our view that there should be no compromise on food safety and health
discussion of these issues and paying serious attention to improving the situation are important  that is why i supported this report
madam president mr reul you are the chair of the committee  ladies and gentlemen let us all calm down a little
this is such an important issue for us all  i believe europe needs nuclear power but it needs safe nuclear power
i should like to thank you for your attention and in particular for your constructive cooperation in this important european project
el the next item is the statements by the council and the commission on the deterioration of the situation in georgia
i believe it is an important step in ensuring clear and unambiguous information to consumers when they are purchasing processed foods
de mr president i have a question for mr pottering will you still have the right to vote in this parliament
the eu should demonstrate its full support for georgia systematically increase cooperation and facilitate visa arrangements for georgians without delay
the rapid pace of technological development in the global information society calls for comprehensive and coherent rules on data protection
this resolution rejects the draft financial framework that has been presented to us and that is why i support it
lastly i hope that the member states together with the eu scrupulously apply the european legislation on feed and food
i confirm what mr tannock has just said and for the same reasons we request that paragraph be deleted
de mr president there is a great deal of euphoria regarding galileo  however there are two enormous downers

the supposedly peaceful russian armed forces should immediately be replaced by independent peaceful forces under eu or un command
i voted in favour of the text presented by mr voss on personal data protection measures within the eu
i voted in favour of this report which also has the virtue of reviving the debate on aviation security

mr president mr rubig i am genuinely sorry i cannot answer this very specialised question offhand  i will have to give you a written answer

mr president designate you expressed a wish for a strong europe  i fear that your attitude will only contribute to the ultimate disappearance of the european union

i have another request from the group of the greens european free alliance who would like tuesday morning s debate on food safety to conclude in a resolution
first of all let me congratulate elmar brok for preparing a report which so magnificently represents the mainstream and let me repeat that the mainstream of this house
we have a lot of work ahead of us and i know i can count on parliament  i hope i can also count on the member states
it sets specific objectives and confirms energy performance contracting as an instrument for purchasing guaranteed energy savings and a launch pad for creating jobs and reducing european citizens bills
it mr president commissioner ladies and gentlemen the energy efficiency action plan should be revised in accordance with a holistic approach that combines europe s numerous strategic policies
in addition member states can promote energy efficiency through the requirements stipulated in public procurement procedures  therefore priority must be given to businesses which use cleaner technologies
the next item is the statement by mr prodi nominee for president of the commission followed by a debate between the political groups without a final resolution
however in my opinion it is essential to pool our human and material resources through europol in order to make the fight against these crimes more effective
such a system is easy to conceive and is also viable given how slack certain member states usually are when it comes to carrying out customs checks
in order to maintain the integrity of our proposal we must reject amendment no which seeks to exclude urban passenger transport from the scope of the directive
parliament must therefore be vigilant and make sure that the european external action service will be a centre of excellence representing the best expertise in foreign policy

mr president commissioner ladies and gentlemen i would like to start by thanking mr bendtsen and the other rapporteurs for their productive cooperation on this report
we must make the target an achievable one we cannot let this opportunity pass us by since it would send out an encouraging signal to europe
last but not least i believe that public authorities must set an example in this respect and turn the buildings they own into energy efficient buildings
although this political strength is our main demand for the future commission we also have other demands particularly regarding the internal working of this commission
paedophilia is one limit others for example are incitement to racial hatred and so called snuff movies which show real examples of torture and killing
finally i must insist on the strengthening of the consultation procedures of the management committees and the standing group on the promotion of agricultural products
i nevertheless believe that the third phase of the life programme should be extended from five to seven years with a proportionate increase in funding
we feel very strongly that if we encourage small and medium sized enterprises to participate in the scheme we shall also be encouraging job creation
i was talking about the first proposal which aims to replace the item earthquake in taiwan with a new item titled nuclear accident in japan

however where more specific sales promotions are concerned i think that the private companies and producer organisations involved should also participate in the financing
i must formally protest about the policy of war being conducted in europe supported by the european union on the orders of the americans !

mr president i will try to be very brief and will confine myself to the oral question to the commission on imports of garlic
furthermore production is highly concentrated in certain geographical areas  the social and economic consequences of the present situation will therefore be very serious

i commend them to the house and trust that they will have the support both of the commission and more importantly of the council
madam president ladies and gentlemen life is the only financial instrument the european union has to intervene directly in the field of the environment

i welcome the fact that the high representative and the heads of the diplomatic missions should engage in permanent dialogue with the european parliament
that is why i believe that the latter is a much more versatile and much more useful procedure for fighting crime wrongdoing and terrorism
i therefore give the floor to the nominee for president of the commission mr prodi whom i would also welcome to the house
reception is only the first stage  we must also facilitate the return of these people to their country and ensure their reintegration
i really must take the floor because mr gahrton has made a number of unfounded statements in the short time he had available
i also believe creating this service will add a significant political dimension to the european project and give europe a more political profile
how can i be sure that if this resolution is accepted nobody is going to hug and kiss war criminals on my behalf
lastly setting mandatory efficiency targets is a good thing because without them it will be difficult to achieve ambitious results within the eu
with the kosovo crisis raging a new urgency is given to the two council proposals to deal with the situation of refugees
i also endorse her criticism of the council s attitude to parliament consultation did indeed take place at a very late stage
my speaking time has run out  i only hope that this report really is adopted and adopted by a large majority
therefore we need to look at the defects in the system and in its application without destroying the usefulness of this warrant
i deeply regret this situation which will unfortunately prevent a balance being achieved in european agriculture and between each member state
this is why i will support mr happart s amendments  i also wish him every success in his new work
i must say you are looking very glamorous this morning  one would not have known your suitcase had not arrived
the problem is one of pace  the problem itself was identified as far back as but the solution was inadequate
thank you mrs maes  i shall take note of your statement even though it does not relate to the minutes
absolutely mr salafranca sanchez  i shall be happy to do that on behalf of the european parliament as a whole
mr president i am very grateful to be asked my opinion but i rather doubt that it will be my decision
the final point is that this debate cannot be separated from the debate on the budget for the european development fund
lastly the report will be all the more useful if binding emissions targets can be set without any ifs or buts
as the internet is no respecter of national frontiers cooperation between member states to tackle this reprehensible practice is vital
the proposal now before us is a result of that desire and also of the wishes of the agriculture ministers
thank you mr maccormick  i think that you will have ample opportunity to raise that point during the debate
the text on which we are preparing to vote tomorrow is an excellent foundation for the negotiations ahead of us
we also need to do something about the bail situation not least by implementing the framework decision on supervision orders
now that energy is a shared european competence under the lisbon treaty energy efficiency must also be a shared responsibility
it mr president commissioner ladies and gentlemen i should like to thank the rapporteur mr bendtsen for his precise report
i believe this is the right system for seeking resources and ensuring that efficiency is no longer a taboo subject
we believe that we have acted in the best traditions of parliamentarians responsible exercising leadership and acting with integrity
the labour government will not rest until the perpetrators of this evil business are stopped and brought to justice
finally amendment no which seeks to expand the definition of mobile workers to include rail workers is not acceptable
i should be grateful if the statement could be followed by a short debate as provided for under rule

number of interparliamentary delegations delegations to joint interparliamentary committees and delegations to parliamentary cooperation committees and multilateral parliamentary assemblies

madam president i would like to a propose a procedural motion on the layout of the new chamber
the request is outside the deadline but if it is accepted    are there any objections

consequently i believe that the arrest warrant should continue in force in revitalised form with better procedural guarantees
we shall now hear a statement by the nominee for president of the commission mr romano prodi
mr president mrs green has the unfortunate habit of turning a political remark into a personal one
we may therefore have the means  all that is lacking may be to find the will
the report contains a number of environmentally friendly proposals to which we have already given our support
on the whole the report is and here we quote the environment committee more brown than green
this major reform of the lisbon treaty has to be made to work and will do so
i would be more specific on two outstanding issues which were raised several times during the debate
on behalf of my group i hope that you will be courageous and enjoy every success !
the report also calls for a degree of harmonisation and supranationalism which we have voted against
finally mr funk mentioned co financing  i hope that co financing is forgotten about forever
i have received three motions for resolutions to wind up the debate tabled pursuant to rule
mr president i want to congratulate mr mcmahon on the presentation of a very fine report

it mr president ladies and gentlemen mr bendtsen s report is positive for at least four reasons

mr president i am pleased to see commissioner fischler here but some of the comments i have to make will also refer to commissioner byrne s portfolio
madam president i am amazed at mr corbett s reaction  he should find other ways of raising his profile than expressing views on such matters here
mr president our group fully supports the report by mr sjostedt  my speech will focus on what we believe to be the most important aspects
something which parliament has always asked for are margins of error for the individual sectors of the budget and this also applies to the agricultural budget
how great is the margin of error in the dairy sector for example  how much is it in the cereal sector or the tobacco sector
i should like to make clear the commission position on some of the amendments and i will also try to answer mr casaca s four questions
we will have to come back to the other more general political questions because i would like to restrict my comments to the proposal before us
i would also like to say that we are worried about the scant support especially in the budget we believe there is for transport safety systems
the removal of this fund would penalise the countries which have managed to comply with the requirements for joining the euro and would simply be intolerable
mr president commissioner mr president in office of the council my committee has very carefully considered its amendments and its vote to introduce them was unanimous
firstly why did the commission decide to extend the coverage of this type of disaster in its proposal to disasters of an environmental and technological nature
however commissioner barnier mentioned what i believe to be an extremely valid consideration and that is the responsibility of the council and the member states governments
i hope that the commission will ensure that good communication is established with society so that it is possible to seize the opportunities that present themselves

with your permission mr heaton harris i will refer your questions on export refunds to my colleague mr fischler later

today europe is facing a similar challenge and we know that just as history has been unforgiving in the past it will not be forgiving in the present
this is the keynote idea on the new governance which we would have liked to have seen in your communication mr prodi but which is unfortunately not there
this means that in terms of quantity management too we need to put in considerable effort to ensure that life upstream and downstream is not affected by it
could the commissioner answer two questions  firstly he talked about verification  can he tell us how that verification will take place and who will do it

nothing comes of a centralised policy  first greece fell now ireland is falling and behind them are portugal and spain  the exercise will soon be over
member of the commission  mr president here is my brief supplement to what was introduced by president barroso after listening to the comments of the honourable members
mr president thanks are due to the commissioner for the competition report but congratulations also go to both rapporteurs for presenting us with their analysis of the issue
finally we take the view that it would benefit the democratic legitimacy of economic competition legislation if parliament too were to be given codecision rights in this area
these then are some of the problems we should be tackling  it is unfortunate that we have failed to do so in the course of this debate
mr president i would like to ask the movers of amendments nos and to clarify whether they intend that this should ban the therapeutic cloning of human embryos
in particular the invitation made to the eib to adopt and apply the definition of smes established by the commission is essential for access by the smallest smes
mr president commissioner i too congratulate the rapporteur on his excellent work  i am particularly pleased about the unanimity shown on this issue within the group
the treaty of amsterdam reiterates the priority criteria for prevention for the implementation of the polluter pays principle and for sustainable development through an environmental impact assessment
you did not fully answer the last part of my question on large scale energy transmission networks  could you please give an answer on this issue
for five years i have been the representative of the committee on the environment in a regional organisation which assuredly does not have parliament s broad perspective
i endorse this view  i will give my support to the commission and i hope that lisbon will take us a step forward in this matter
it mr president ladies and gentlemen i believe that the european parliament is being called upon to confirm its approach an approach of responsibility vision and unity
fr mr president mr wathelet mr barroso i should like to thank the european commission and the belgian presidency for their open cooperative and indeed european approach
on a personal level may i add that we will save time by involving national parliaments as they are sovereign in terms of taxation and budgetary matters
in short and this brings me back to where i started competition policy is about creating an equilateral triangle around economic policy social policy and the environment
smoking kills the litany is becoming tiring  i will therefore take the liberty of irritating some people by repeating that smoking kills one in two smokers
enlargement and alleanza nazionale has been repeating this for ten years in this house must not mean dilution that is it must not entail more risks
moreover it will only be possible to give the commission responsibility for the tasks it takes on according to the actual powers it will be accorded
we debate these issues intensively and seriously and we should be entitled to expect likewise from the commission even where it is merely submitting a paper
i am now going to briefly discuss the main issues on which the spanish socialist delegation differs somewhat from certain positions which have been expressed here
however local authorities have repeatedly expressed the view that partnership arrangements under the new csf for greece have remained unchanged and are singularly lacking in substance
report a by mr lipietz on behalf of the committee on economic and monetary affairs on the commission s xxxist report on competition policy sec c cos
if i understand correctly next year we shall have a single report on competition policy and state aid policy  i am delighted to hear it
also this field is the sovereign responsibility of the member states which are undoubtedly in a better position to assess the situation of their labour market
we also reject all the calls for public funding in the interests of private capital even if those interests are hidden behind the needs of research
the next item is the continuation of the debate on the recommendation for second reading of the community action in the field of water policy
amendment no does not take account of seasonal variations and annual changes in the level of the groundwater  the proposal cannot therefore be approved
to summarise the commission is able to approve amendments either in their entirety partially or in principle  the following amendments cannot be approved and
da the left s five members of the european parliament have chosen to support leader the equal initiative and interreg but not urban
the interreg initiative launched in to prepare the border regions for a europe without borders and therefore without nations sits comfortably within this philosophy
mr president i think i also speak for the committee on constitutional affairs that i chair in expressing my appreciation of this commission initiative
i would like to hear the commissioner s view on amendment no  i may have missed it in the list she gave out
before giving the rapporteur the floor i would like to welcome mr maystadt president of the european investment bank who will speak later on
report a by mr herzog on behalf of the committee on economic and monetary affairs on the scoreboard for state aid spring update ini
madam president in the short time available there being two reports to be discussed i will try to consider a number of different issues
i think that your comments which were also a complaint should be carefully considered  i hope that you will receive a positive response
mr president of the commission this is indeed an historic moment for parliament a five year programme following the crisis of the commission
the european parliament has delivered an opinion on the commission guidelines for the interreg community initiative concerning cross border transnational and interregional cooperation
the french delegation in our group is therefore unable to support the decourriere report and will choose to abstain during the final vote
i therefore believe that it is very important for everyone to back this european union plan and for it to be further developed
mr president every satellite photo proves that we do indeed live on the blue planet yet the abundance of water is an illusion
is the commission prepared to adopt an action plan to increase the active participation of women in decision making in the environmental field
it mr president ladies and gentlemen the failure of the trialogue represents a major political opportunity to reflect on europe s recent history
mr president we propose to reintroduce from the original commission text the words after consultation of the social partners in the first sentence
we withdraw the first part of the amendment which deleted three words therefore we retain the terms in the report financing the economy
the implementation of careful supervision rules in the european union will protect saving and give people confidence in investments in stocks and shares
we are here to highlight the political dimensions of the economic crisis as we fight with the workers to overturn this rotten system
this can be prevented if a european social model is drawn up and if results are achieved in all these concrete areas
i shall finish by restating my conviction that without economic and social cohesion there will be no cohesion at all only disunity
so far portugal has had six projects financed on behalf of the municipal authorities of oporto gondomar lisbon odivelas oeiras and amadora
that is all i have to say for the moment  i welcome any questions suggestions or proposals from the members present
i will go further in the written answer which i have promised in order to set things out more objectively and precisely
my question would have been almost exactly the one raised by mr purvis but i would like to press the point further
madam president commissioner mr maystadt i want to begin by thanking mrs van den burg for the sterling work she has done
in view of this unusual situation will the commission say why the ohim has not yet moved to its new premises
madam president mr prodi you claim to be shaping a new europe yet you are lacking one basic element confidence
consequently we too shall also vote to reserve our right to refer the proposal back to committee if need be
fourthly we should like exemptions from the rules on water status to be kept to a minimum and clearly defined
my question therefore is this will the commission make this one of the conditions in order to improve future discussions
i hope we can meet the challenge which the honourable member has posed for the commission and the whole convention
could the commission look at this particular situation in relation to the agreement that was signed with the uk government
may i thank mr andersson for the supplement to his first question and may i answer that question as follows
lastly it is a fact that the draft budget makes no and i mean no financial provision for the strategy
they are capital increase pension funds labour market policy and employment policy eu enlargement and adequate supervision of eib policy
and where implementation is concerned the commission needs to ensure that our political wishes are also implemented in practice
fifthly the protection of groundwater status and measures against persistent pollution of the groundwater should be transparent and clear
since the time allotted to questions to the commission has elapsed questions to will be replied to in writing
the commission approves amendment no to the effect that radioactive substances are explicitly to be included in the proposal
this is why i cannot vote for a text which far from achieving its objectives runs counter to them
madam president president of the commission this is a vital document for the future and fate of europe
the rules of procedure do not allow this  you will have to discuss this outside the chamber
i would like to be very clear on the commission s position regarding a number of key points
mr president thank you for coming here today and for the information you have kindly shared with us
the debate has already taken place  i think that the intentions are quite clear in the text
for all these reasons the french delegation of the uen group could not approve the mccarthy report
mr president it is difficult to summarise the areas covered by such a large and complex directive
the next item is the commission communication the dialogue on europe institutional reform the issues at stake
it seems to me commissioner that the commission has the responsibility to promote and coordinate these opportunities
flexibility this mechanism has been used effectively so far and all member states have benefited from it
the eu should instead immediately abolish the extensive subsidies it pays out for the cultivation of tobacco
the eplp has supported this report at first reading but with the strong reservations set out here
this and this alone is the reason why i have voted against this motion for a resolution
in the same context increasing investments in the field of accommodation will enhance the important construction sector
thank you mrs banotti  i think your intervention may clarify various points that were raised
as an mep from a border region i welcome this third interreg initiative with great interest
fr the interreg community initiative is just one element of an ill fated european regional policy
we think leader will be even more ineffectual than leader and leader for the following reasons
mr president i too would like to start by congratulating mrs lienemann on her excellent work
i should just like to point out once again that the joint text still holds good
i have some important remarks to make now and i shall change to my mother tongue
the eplp voted for amendment to support comprehensive and effective impact assessments  this helps smes
madam president words are essential but we can only judge the commission on its merits
parliament has proposed eur million but the document repeats the initial proposal of eur million
mr schulz i did hear your question  i believe no one has been spared
thanks also to commission president barroso and commissioner lewandowski for your contribution to our discussion
thank you commissioner  we should be thanking you for your efforts under such conditions

mr president i should like to propose the following oral amendment namely to replace the final words in the german text i  e zu vertiefen by weiterzufuhren
i would like to begin my comments by saying that i welcome the irish peace agreement reached at the multi party talks in belfast on good friday last

drawing inspiration from the electricity directive the gas market will have to respect the same broad principles of access to the network subsidiarity reciprocity and so on
fourthly by encouraging research and innovation and the development of new technology and more broadly speaking a spirit of creation and creativity in all areas particularly farming
i think that especially after the lisbon treaty and the charter of fundamental rights enter into force the eu should further elaborate its approach towards these communities
es mr president mr barroso i would like you to clearly express your point of view on two matters associated with the composition of the next commission
with regard to the specific question that you asked me it is the responsibility of the member states to decide whether or not they recognise another state
in recent years the commission has fulfilled its mission to hunt down state aid with a somewhat blind zeal seeing aid to be criticised practically everywhere
mr berthu your remark does not pertain to the minutes for yesterday  nonetheless it has been noted and a response will be provided when appropriate
finally i would like once again to express our solidarity with the galicians and i hope the european union demonstrates that same solidarity through its actions
mr president we would avoid problems like that raised by mr medina ortega if the rapporteur would not preside when we are dealing with his report
the danish social democrats are of the opinion that unemployment is one of the worst problems currently facing the eu and we welcome the following key positions
my question mr president is who will take responsibility for the reduced nuclear safety in this region and for the increased risk to european union citizens
we europeans through our values of solidarity and fraternity have a responsibility to find a solution to this situation quickly before it turns into a bloodbath
we disagree with its call for state aid to be reduced and with its misguided approach to state funding of private providers of general interest services
in the framework of competition policy the half yearly publication of the scoreboard for state aid since is an important tool for transparency and debate
for this reason i would like once again to thank the european parliament for its particularly important and especially creative contribution to this great effort
mr president i would like it to be recorded that i am present from now on and i will not take part in the vote
mrs thors as you are aware this is a common practice and when reports do not present problems it does not matter in the least
mr berthu i am not in the habit of making comments of course but i must say you have taken a really very prophetic tone
amongst the forgotten problems in particular is a privileged relationship in terms of development that which unites france with the countries of the franc zone
mr barroso i warmly welcome your statement just now that you intend that there should be a portfolio within the commission dealing with fundamental rights
mr president this was the first time i had taken part in one of these delegations  i found it fascinating but also frustrating

you are quite right  i would very much like to achieve that  unfortunately it is not provided for by the treaty
i have here for your perusal the precise movements of the prestige during and provided by the maritime authority of the bahamas

of course mr collins  it was a mistake  we did note your presence and the matter will be rectified
absolutely mr rubig  if a declaration was made but not recorded in the minutes we shall look into the matter

for these reasons we shall be voting against the report and the proposal for a council directive

application of the protocol on the excessive deficit procedure annexed to the ec treaty codified version

we will send a technician so that you will be able to participate in the vote

there is strength in partnership  let us get on with it and work together

let me finally say a few words about parliament itself and about the commission

we have to stop now because we have gone well beyond thirty minutes

i support the proposals to create an inventory of all spatial data remote sensing and agro meteorological projects and to consolidate the existing spatial data infrastructure and websites
the risk for consumers of getting into debt remains far too high  control and transparency by setting up databases of the creditworthiness of every consumer seems essential
we are delighted by this  this report is a first step towards the beginnings of freedom of expression and clear sightedness  we will vote in favour
the specific rule concerning unfair competition is very important for judges and lawyers  the same rule also limits to a large extent the practice of forum shopping
i propose that we vote on the request of the group of the party of european socialists that the commission statement on its strategic objectives should be reinstated
in spite of the appalling attacks by the left the plenary remained clearly on the side of freedom  this is reason to be pleased and hopeful
i shall therefore vote against the barroso commission through lack of confidence in the sincere hope that i may be able to change my mind in future
at the very least there are two tasks which are essential  the success of the lisbon strategy and the successful ratification of the european constitutional treaty
unlike the eu arrest warrant system in which turkey has no part there is no implied principle of mutual recognition of judicial decisions between the states involved
i could return the flattery and say that up until now i thought we were doing quite well but it is beginning to get a little repetitive
but adult learning  surely this of all fields is one that ought to be determined by national electorates through their own proper democratic mechanisms and procedures
it was therefore necessary to set limits  the lender will not therefore be able to claim compensation of more than of the value of the credit
it is important to define the notion of environmental damage which is in harmony with other european union legislation and in particular with the environmental liability directive
as there does not appear to be any opposition on your part to mrs corbey s proposal we are therefore going to vote on these two amendments
i would like to thank those meps who have submitted resolutions on cambodia for this urgency debate  the situation there is indeed a matter of concern
i have to say that i voted in favour of this measure as a loyal conservative following the whip but i did so with great reluctance
many thanks for that information mr wurtz  if it is true it makes the vote that we are about to hold all the more pressing
the next item is the statement by the high representative of the european union for foreign affairs and security policy regarding the eu s arctic policy
madam president i trust that sound was not a sign that a storm is on its way and i hope the weather will remain fine
i hope you will understand that i cannot add to what i have already said and that this is a matter for the commission
the next sitting will take place tomorrow thursday november from a m  to p m  and from p m  to p m
i understand for example the rapporteur s concern over the impossibility of comparing data between different member states owing to the different frequency of analyses
however i deplore the attempts to remove references in the report to adolescents right to sexual and reproductive health and family planning education and services
bearing in mind the vote that is going to take place shortly i think it important that each of you be aware of this fact
i believe that this fact is all the more important given that the european union has not been given unfortunately observer status in this forum
in view of these procedural requirements the european council envisages that the move to the codecision procedure should take effect no later than april
in writing  fr i voted in favour of the report proposing the harmonisation of the laws of the member states on consumer credit

we do wish as the committee proposes to regret this military operation s being financed from outside the eu s normal budget paragraph
strongly opposes the establishment of a european return fund and the appointment by the commission of a special representative for a common readmission policy
in july you wrote the principle of individual responsibility of commissioners into your speeches  well today we want that promise in stone
i notice that the gavel is going down after exactly one minute and not seconds later as it has done for everyone else
now is the time for parliament to make an equally sensible move by supporting your commission and contributing to its reputation and strength
as you can see mr president designate certain questions remain and we hope that this debate will serve to reassure us this evening
mr kilroy silk you must respect speaking times like everybody else and furthermore what you have said is not a point of order
the european convention on extradition under the auspices of the council of europe to which turkey is a party follows a similar logic
i really have nothing to add on behalf of the presidency  this is a discussion you should have with the commission
if i understand correctly mr purvis that was a comment and not a point of order  i have taken note of it
madam president may i add my thanks alongside those to yourself to your staff and to the interpreters for patience and good humour
mr medina ortega rightly pointed out that the decisions and practices of the courts will be the most important element in this area
in conclusion i believe that when iceland joins the european union the eu will have a more important role in this strategic region
maintaining the embargo on arms sales to china is a welcome sign of where the eu s priorities lie in this field
it has been written that this mission will step up the preparation for bosnia and herzegovina s eventual accession to the eu
given the needs of the people of bosnia and herzegovina and the eu s duty to show solidarity i voted in favour
i am really sorry but if we are to come to an understanding that is not at all politically correct mr barroso
my reaction is the same  i cannot tell you what is under discussion in the council and between member states
the resolution is a wish list which is not up to the serious problem threatening the future of the planet
mr president mr president designate i voted for you in july but today i wish to share my worries with you
mr president in the words of mao zedong as long as one is falling one has still not reached the bottom
around members and myself look forward to a self confident successful and fair cooperation  i wish you all the best
what will the council do within its area of responsibility to enable european firms to trade more easily in the us
we have got to be much more careful in the way that we deal with this sort of very important legislation

sk madam president we need to keep renewing our knowledge throughout our working life not only during our years at school
author  mr president i am delighted that you follow the mediterranean diet and see it is very successful for you !
yes mrs schroedter i shall be pleased to look into the facts of this case when i have received your letter
finally mr kilroy silk who spoke earlier patently has not even found his way to the classroom of his kindergarten
thank you for your remarks but i have nothing to add to what i said in my first answer
it is an issue under discussion in the council  i cannot add anything to what i said earlier
in conclusion i believe that before we go ahead with this we should have a referendum on the lisbon treaty
in writing  fr the report by mr lechner on opening up the european consumer loans market was adopted today
despite the discrepancies displayed in the eu targets efforts and programmes in the lifelong learning sector still deserve our support
today the european parliament has adopted a report on the european union s code of conduct on arms exports

the european parliament is here using an important global environmental conference to increase the supranational element of eu cooperation
mr president elect the alliance of liberals and democrats is ready to give you and your commission its support
mr barroso your team will no doubt be confirmed in office tomorrow but will be so without our support
recently the wanted man was arrested in istanbul on smuggling charges but was released despite interpol s arrest warrant
i do not have anything to add  i hope my answer was enough to explain the position
sk madam president i have voted for the council common position which was amended by the kurt lechner report
however we should point out that the report fails to address the causes of situations that it sometimes diagnoses
i am sorry but i do not think we should listen to personal comments like that in this chamber
in any event this question is not presently included among the requests for topical and urgent debate on thursday
we are probably the only members of this house who find the conclusions of the brussels summit unacceptable
oh ! i see that the gavel is going down very quickly when i am speaking mr president !
mr barroso we wish you broad support for your new commission and every success in your difficult job
thank you very much mr toubon  we shall verify what you say and make corrections where necessary
ladies and gentlemen the next item is question time during which we will examine questions to the council
that is rather a new question and one which i regret to say i cannot answer immediately
cs ladies and gentlemen i am pleased that today after six years of discussions we have provided europe with
madam president one minute without repetition deviation or what was the other one  hesitation ! quite so
i am delighted that parliament has allocated debating time to this subject and i fully endorse this report
madam president i have no doubt but that everyone in the house will have understood what i said !
ro i would like to take the floor in my capacity as rapporteur of this parliament for iceland
the next item is the debate on the statement by mr barroso president elect of the commission
has the council assessed the effectiveness of the common position and the diplomatic pressure exerted on cuba
mr ortuondo larrea i intended to take one more question and then question time will be concluded
the question is how it will be used and who will be using it hence our abstention
the revival of growth through consumption is achieved by raising pay and not by increasing available credit !
we deplore the fact for example that the following proposals tabled by our group were not adopted
we wish you much success with it mr president  you can count on our cooperation
mr president elect of the commission i wish you the best of luck in that task
mr president on a point of order i am grateful for the opportunity to address you
i am very sorry but we had no interpretation for the last part of your speech
is there a member who wishes to speak on behalf of this group to propose this
your speaking time has finished  we will not have personal comments of that nature
this is why we will vote against all the motions for resolutions tabled today
i shall now give the floor to mr nicolai on behalf of the council
however the number of people who maintain these healthy dietary habits has been falling
all of these issues and measures come within the remit of the european commission
mr president firstly i want to thank the members who participated in the debate
we meps of the communist party of greece are voting against the report
until you have fixed these problems i must unfortunately vote against the commission
i cannot say much more but i can elaborate a little bit
i am sure he will tell you after we have closed the sitting !
all in all i find the final text a satisfactory and balanced compromise
el may i extend a welcome to the high representative for foreign affairs
this is all in accordance with the principles that we have always upheld
this place looks more and more like the soviet union every day
murder of the human rights activist munir said thalib written declaration see minutes
thank you very much mr nicolai mr barroso has the floor
the next item is cambodia specifically the case of sam rainsy
the ones who lose out are the people and peace
my country deserves better and it will get better !
you have not in any way answered my question
questions no to will be answered in writing
we shall now move to the next speaker
thank you for your remark
time but not your subject
discharge economic and social committee
eu policy on arctic issues debate
applause the oral question will therefore remain on the agenda and yes your president is entitled to vote just as she is entitled to forget her voting card
everything i have said today is a clear illustration that the economic social and environmental threads of our policies are all intertwined both in planning and in execution
the commissioner responsible mr solbes has given us an initial presentation with regard to the approach and the timetable and soon the relevant specific documents will be presented
although a reunited cyprus is not considered a criterion for accession to the european union which i am pleased about a peaceful political settlement is still a priority
sv i have voted in favour of the report in the final vote and against all amendments from the committee on legal affairs and the internal market
in this context these trivial measures on which we will abstain are pathetic in their attempt to bring morality into a system that is essentially amoral and inhuman
madam president has my vote been counted  i was unable to vote electronically since i do not have a card  my vote was in favour
mr president commissioner the proposal presented by the commission in accordance with its mandate is a reasonable starting point for the committee on agriculture and rural development
finally i should like to mention a few political conclusions which you are in any case familiar with but whose main elements i should like to reiterate
i am going to focus on the three great priorities mentioned by the president and i will leave it to other members to deal with specific aspects
with regard more specifically to possible accession by turkey to the european union we should not forget that the real issue of europe s borders remains unresolved
the term cooperation is not confined to the exchange of information specifically about crime but also covers the prevention and investigation of criminal offences which is unacceptable
lastly consensus was reached on a declaration on the situation in the middle east which confirms the existing consensus between the eu and russia on this matter
last but not least the european union must adequately protect its borders at all times a task for which it was essential to respect the schengen acquis
mr president first of all i would like to thank the rapporteur not least for being willing to include in the report the suggestions we made
the public will be able to follow all stages of the dialogue step by step since the documents forwarded will be accessible via our web pages
these priorities have already been endorsed by the council and this assembly  i will now look at how the commission intends implementing them next year
report a by elmar brok on behalf of the committee on foreign affairs human rights common security and defence policy on enlargement progress report com c ini
i note that the english is the authoritative version and as i said earlier we will ensure after the vote that all language versions are correct
the procedure came under paragraph mr corbett  you can consult the services to understand the rule that you happily furnished us with several months ago
mr president i would like to add the words the financial reference amount has to be compatible with the ceilings of heading of the financial perspective
this report highlights the extraordinary work carried out by the democratic cypriot authorities to implement the community acquis in cyprus and thereby make good their commitments
as a swedish christian democrat i felt compelled to support the restrictive and winning policy votes in favour votes against and abstentions in the european parliament
we shall proceed to vote on the ppe de group s request that the oral question regarding the capital tax be withdrawn from the agenda
this is the last time that we shall make allowances for members who have forgotten their cards  let that be clearly noted and understood
as i said yesterday our main challenge for the coming year will be enlargement once more  so it is naturally our top priority for
this work programme seeks to bring more continuity and coherence to our political action through ever closer cooperation between parliament the council and the commission
we are all aware of this and yet will be quite special  to me the coming year will be crucial for europe s history
the commission has recently presented a proposal for a european return programme  that is already under discussion in the council s specialised working groups
it is therefore necessary to link structural financing more closely to job creation  this commissioner is the first commandment for the coming period
mr president i would ask that mrs diamantopoulou mr nielson and mr vitorino may speak next since many issues have been addressed to them
in the face of these powers governments like the european authorities only bow down and respect the speculative stock market profits and board secrets
the seriousness of the prospect of there being liaison officers who are dispatched by the various member states without any monitoring by the police authorities
first we think the motion for a resolution on environmental protection under the common fisheries policy is a good idea and we support it
mr president commissioner i too would like to commend the rapporteur on her report which is a meticulous and substantive piece of work
indeed if we add the two members who have declared themselves then the result of the vote would be
this development of our philosophy and approach was endorsed and given impetus by the conclusions of the seville european council last june
mr president i will speak very briefly to allow other colleagues to reply in relation to the areas specific to their responsibilities
mr president as a member of the eu bulgaria joint parliamentary committee i am pleased that the brok report has been adopted
the european union should therefore create an area of privileged relations with our closest neighbours turkey russia and the north african countries
in the current economic climate people are rightly asking what the eu will do to help restore growth and create jobs
having said this we welcome the three political priorities set by the commission and we would like to make the following comments
mr president president prodi has described three fundamental points of the programme and in general i support the overall line taken
i would ask the commission how it intends to integrate this ambitious timetable for enlargement with improved economic competitiveness in europe
this resolution provides a balanced view of the impact of enlargement on agriculture and small and medium sized businesses and industries
mr president ladies and gentlemen i believe we should support the fundamental health protection efforts being made in the european union
furthermore i agree with the rapporteur in that we will need a larger budget if these aims are to be fulfilled !
the next item is the statements made by the council and the commission on the outcome of the eu russia summit
we must not see our borders as a wall  but nor must we see them as rolling forward inexorably
a few weeks ago we discussed the coordination of economic policy and the stability and growth pact in this house
externally the goal is to control and manage the process of globalisation so the largest possible number enjoy its benefits
mr president on a point of order that does not come under rule a  this is a second reading
madam president the presidency has already declared the result of the vote  there is no room for amendments
finally the amendment tabled by the rapporteur is perfectly logical and i can therefore give it my wholehearted support
pl mr president i would like to make an unequivocal statement concerning the report we voted on this morning
even if the report is federalist on a number of points therefore we have to support its final adoption
pt i have voted in favour of the brok report although i did vote against paragraph for two reasons
fr every day tobacco kills more people and every year over europeans die from smoking or passive smoking
madam president i would like to thank mr poettering for advertising this debate  thank you very much
i would like to repeat my appreciation to all the speakers and especially to the rapporteur mr koch
the legislative and work programme i am presenting today therefore represents a major step towards better european governance
it is in practice an additional consumer tax  it therefore puts a strain on the poorest households
mr president i should like to add my support to your speech on the scotsman and the herald
the whole text apart from the pre allocation for euronews and the reserves this part was adopted
i would emphasise that the commission sets much store by parliament s valuable contribution to this process
let us not forget that we must meet our objectives of sustainable economic prosperity and social inclusion
again as i assured you earlier we will correct all of the linguistic versions after the vote
mr president i must point out that those who voted against this have not understood a thing
i therefore call on the commission to present a proposal to regulate these two types of crime
we will only vote in favour of this draft directive if these two shortcomings are made good
even now european banks are still making huge profits from the trafficking of drugs arms and people
pre allocation of eur million for euronews by roll call vote this part was also adopted
da mr president the tenth eu russia summit took place in brussels on november with satisfactory results
to this end the commission must make available financial resources that are appropriate to this fight
that is why the meps of the communist party of greece did not support the report
no doubt this is the first move in the next set of proceedings in the ecj
the next item is the commission statement on the annual legislative and work programme for
let me mention the major innovations of the working method the commission followed this year
the motions for resolutions on these items will be voted on in brussels on december
exceptionally i will permit one brief comment but there will be no debate on this
trying to reconcile trade secrets with combating corruption is like trying to square the circle
pt i wish to congratulate mr di lello on the quality of his work
that is why we vote  we have the chance to register our views
in abstaining from voting on this report we would like to highlight its hopelessness
i am sorry but explanations of vote are not permitted at the moment
the commission s two other priorities for have a close link with enlargement
mr president i think mr swoboda s proposal is a very wise one
let me return to paragraph with what is now a new oral amendment
i believe this is an important point and it is worth correcting it
thank you for adding a touch of mystery to an otherwise interesting vote
i am therefore in favour of new control measures at community level specifically through
mr president my compliments to the rapporteur for his in depth report
the president established that there was no objection to the oral amendment
these in brief are the reasons for my vote against the report
reserves for the pre allocation for euronews this part was rejected
i call on mr haarder to speak on behalf of the council
social and economic situation and development of the regions of the union
the third major priority for the coming year is economic policy
i shall pass that question on to the administration mr posselt
the original text will be part of the vote on paragraph
all we can do is to suggest a few improvements such as
the outcome of the split vote on amendment no was as follows
we shall now hear mr wurtz speaking against this request
parliament rejected the request with votes for votes against and abstentions
we shall continue with the other amendments to the agenda
we now move on to the catch the eye procedure
mr president could you explain procedurally what happened to paragraph
as i assured you we will check the linguistic versions
we will make the linguistic corrections after the vote
compliance with the rules to be monitored by regional organisations
thank you for that early explanation of vote
safety advisers for the transport of dangerous goods
that concludes the catch the eye procedure
we abstained from voting on this report
general reserves this part was adopted
commission annual legislative and work programme for
the priorities identified by the commission are
thank you very much mr haarder
mr haarder is nodding in agreement
i take note of your comments
transport of dangerous goods by road
human rights in vietnam vote
a sustainable and inclusive economy
text abbreviated in accordance with rule
clearer marking and identification of vessels
structural funds cohesion fund coordination
the voting is over
dissuasive and uniform sanctions
what is more this is not an isolated case  the commission and parliament have developed very good working relations in the field of election observation in general
however it is important not to confuse the task of election observation with handling the relationship in general the overall agenda vis a vis the country in question
without wishing to set a precedent because we are not going to continue the debate i am going to give the floor to mr cushnahan for a clarification
the commission chose article as the legal basis for the establishment of the tripartite social summit since that was the legal basis for the standing committee on employment
this overhaul is both timely and welcome  the current legislation has been revised over one hundred times  the new rules will be much simpler and clearer
we must nonetheless seek a solution because of the previous history and also because of the fact that we would otherwise be unable to regulate cross border traffic
just as there are not only risks but also major benefits in the agricultural sector there are not only benefits but also major risks in the medical field
we are therefore able to present a package that will benefit all participants in the internal market businesses especially small and medium sized enterprises and above all consumers
another question of great import that is currently under examination relates to the connection between any specific mark for consumers and all other markings including the ce mark
firms that pursue high frequency trading strategies should be analysed to ensure that they have robust systems and controls with ongoing regulatory reviews of the algorithms they use
i decided to vote for this report because we need to send out a strong signal of europe s desire to work with local and particularly regional administrations
this directive concerns the application of protection measures intended to assist victims of criminal acts whenever these endanger an individual s life or physical psychological or sexual wellbeing
finally we reviewed the situation in moldova and belarus  russia has already agreed to the withdrawal and destruction of ammunition in the breakaway region of transnistria
i should furthermore like to mention the state of the press in karelia and elsewhere too in russia where there are pressures that are simply not acceptable
wherever required for the sake of public health the european food safety authority will propose to the commission maximum residue limits to be laid down in legislation
therefore as my colleague has already pointed out if certain amendments mentioned are approved it will be difficult for us to vote in favour of the report
the adoption of parliament s report and the forthcoming council conclusions will provide the essential political backing for the effective implementation of the strategy at european level
oral question to the commission by arlene mccarthy on behalf of the committee on the internal market and consumer protection concerning safety marking on consumer products b
i think that together we have proven that where the well being of european citizens and the european economy is concerned european institutions are united and efficient
it is astonishing to note how little cooperation still takes place and i believe this package will pave the way for better cooperation among public authorities too
finally i would stress once again that our consumers must take pride of place for without secure and confident consumers we shall not have a flourishing market
this vote represents an important step towards the creation of a european civil protection force that could intervene quickly and effectively wherever there is a serious emergency
underlines that the structure and working methods of the european external action service eeas should aim at ensuring the coherence and consistency of eu action in crisis situations
legal protection has been extended as the victim will no longer be required to restart the whole legal process of gaining protection when moving to another member state
in addition the eu urged the russians to promote without delay a political solution that provides a framework for lasting peace stability and reconstruction in chechnya
at the summit we also had a good discussion on a number of international issues including the middle east on which we agreed a joint statement
security cover was indeed finally provided for the second half of our mission but it came from the provincial governors and not from the federal authorities
furthermore in its statement the presidency expresses concern about reports of manipulation very mild indeed and you ask the election commission to follow up such complaints
but if we already know enough about a medicine new pre clinical and clinical tests impose an unnecessary burden and unnecessary testing on humans and animals
as far as the first type is concerned i welcome the proposed new title  i think it conveys the objective of the directive much better
i agree with the amendment requiring the member states to ensure that both workers and their representatives are equipped to press the provisions of the directive
on the whole we can be very content with the package on the table today  it also enjoys broad support from all the political groups
i voted in favour of the report because it concerns targeted measures to help workers suffering as a result of the economic crisis and its consequences
mr president commissioner i believe that the fate of the entire european union is far more closely intertwined with russia than we imagine at present
madam president i should like to make it clear that i am not speaking on behalf of the eldr or in favour of this resolution
i feel strongly that it is possible to work towards both both towards complete democracy and towards pragmatic attempts to improve the opportunities for peace
these are some of the major issues that parliament has considered  i hope and expect that we will be able to reach constructive solutions
my position is that the rules imposed by this proposal will ensure that coccidiostats are used in a safe manner respecting human and animal health
i am willing for a report to be drawn up on this matter but i cannot agree to a cut off date for the authorisations
in conjunction with this debate i have received six motions for resolutions which were submitted in accordance with rule  of the rules of procedure
the commission appreciates that the mission was able to carry out its task in full compliance with internationally accepted criteria used for election observation
mr president i too wish to congratulate the rapporteur on attempting to find a compromise between the different points of view on this issue
in relation to the ce marking system we are satisfied with the distinction between the provisions of the regulation and those of the decision
this regulation means that goods may move more freely in the eu thereby increasing choice and consumer trust and simplifying the sale of goods
investment firms which provide a portfolio management service and act in a portfolio management capacity should benefit from the best possible terms from investment companies
in addition russia and the european union will immediately launch negotiations with a view to concluding a readmission agreement as soon as possible
the eu also raised a number of its commercial concerns including the discriminatory charges levied by russia for european aircraft flying over siberia
i would like to express my thanks for the debate  thank you very much for your views which i shall pass on
mr president since the beginning of time people have relied on natural vegetable and mineral substances to cure diseases and to relieve pain
mr president i want to congratulate mrs van den burg for an enormously well done job and the commissioner for introducing this directive
the new wording for the group of workers that member states cannot exclude from the scope of the directive is a vast improvement
the alde group will support this compromise in its current form and we welcome the work that has been done on the text
through these new provisions we are ensuring efficient market surveillance and better scrutiny throughout europe  that after all is what really counts
madam president i believe that in this debate we must distinguish between two things as the representative of the commission has said
another significant and additional benefit is that we will have real experts in herbal medicine on this committee which is clearly essential
in my view these amendments will make the directive far more workable and more acceptable to temporary workers agencies and user companies
when we talk about good governance we are talking above all about impartial fair governance in the european union s regional policy
sk mr president i supported the directive because human trafficking is a denial of freedom in the broadest sense of the word
it mr president i asked for the floor to give an explanation of vote on preventing and combating trafficking in human beings
why was the initial draft of your reaction to the election toned down  who influenced you  who pressurised you
but as well as betraying the eu eom and ordinary pakistanis you are also betraying the ideals of your own presidency
the council and commission statements on the extension of the lamfalussy procedure to the entire financial services sector for the copenhagen summit
i urge the commission to submit a report to us on the use of antibiotic growth promoters by the end of
i am looking forward to the debate in the house today and call on the european parliament to support this initiative
we also accept the amendments that clarify the text  the definition proposed for the term assignment is far more accurate
mrs damiao thank you for giving us hope that there is real hope in europe for biotechnology and the life sciences
once more we thank you with all our heart for allowing us the great honour and privilege of addressing you today
sk mr president i would like to talk about the luhan report which is the final topic in today s debate
for several reasons it is important and imperative that this new structure be extended to include the banking and insurance sectors
there will be a greater degree of focus on political issues and thus on the overall principles of the rules

we continue to object on principle to the idea of community funds being used to finance european political parties
exceptionally mr fatuzzo is not here today to give an explanation of vote on behalf of the italian pensioners

we will now suspend the sitting  we will return to the explanations of vote after the formal sitting

with regard to the report that we are debating today the committee on development wishes to stress the following points

question no by dirk sterckx which has been taken over by mr  vermeer h
the commissioner has just told us only what he was able to tell us
the work of the plenary and initiative reports amendment of the rules of procedure debate
so while i agree in principle i had to abstain for the foregoing reasons
the result of the conciliation procedure must be seen as a victory for parliament
overall this is an excellent measure  i commend it to the house

mr president commissioner ladies and gentlemen my thanks go to mechtild rothe  we support the approach she has chosen and obviously her idea for a framework directive
madam president ladies and gentlemen the debate on the services directive has given rise to some powerful emotions and we are still not completely out of the woods
i should like to ask you more specifically exactly how in the council you link the european prospects of serbia montenegro with discussions on the future of kosovo
does the council consider that the case law dating from applying the principle of non discrimination on the ground of nationality to access to higher education is illegitimate
mr president as an austrian and a styrian but the son of a german mother honourable member i am pleased to hear this agreement in your supplementary question
mr president the issue of the challenges facing the european union in the contemporary world of global competition arises in nearly all the debates held in this parliament
mr president every now and then one of the dozens of decisions taken by the european parliament stands out as vital to the future of the european union
there is too little time for further technical analysis but the essence is that the economic liberalism which informs the entire text is not a one way street
mr president it is better to accept the proposed compromise than reject it  in any case this is the starting point for a single viable labour market
i also believe that certain services such as health social services and aspects of education are so sensitive that they should not be covered by this particular measure
bg mr president today s debate is not just about widespread eavesdropping in bulgaria  it is about the alarming tendencies towards the suspension of citizens rights in europe
if our representatives make speeches like this it is our duty as members of the european parliament to denounce them and the commission must keep a close watch
furthermore over recent weeks the price of a barrel of crude has oscillated between and dollars a price that would have seemed unthinkable a few years ago
this report is to be welcomed by the industry and the european parliament and will ensure that we have safe and secure energy supplies in the future
the proposal on which we voted today has been on the table since even though it addresses an issue as crucial as the protection of workers health
the eu must meet these challenges head on without abandoning its historical and social values which are reflected in the core characteristics of existing social protection systems
the rapid liberalisation of world trade characterised by lax rules on work and the environment poses a considerable challenge for the competitiveness of the european economy
the report before us does not raise any objection to the commission s proposal  rather it accepts and supports all of the ideas put forward
mr president i can assure the house that frits bolkestein is alive and kicking and that is why martin schulz is looking so bruised these days !
it is essential as commissioner mccreevy stated that we deliver a better services directive which will unleash the enormous economic potential of the services sector in europe
this is the goal but it is something that will take some time  i am sorry if i repeat myself but this is what it is
as they deal with the same issue the following questions will be taken together and the answer will be given by mr martin bartenstein representing the council
does the austrian presidency intend to revert to the commission proposal for a directive on the portability of additional occupation pensions  what would its approach be
bg mr president the escalation in the use of special eavesdropping devices in bulgaria is a fact which is why the public is so excited and concerned
mr president i was not intending to take the floor now under the catch the eye procedure but was denied the right to raise the blue card
bg first of all mr strasser i would like to say that i cannot agree that there is no information on how eavesdropping devices have been used
member of the commission  mr president this has been a rather heated debate but i would like to emphasise three points which i believe are fundamental
eighthly we regret certain commission decisions with which we do not agree such as the lifting of sanctions on sudan given the serious events in darfur
mr president i in turn should like to start by congratulating my honourable friend mr agnoletto on the important report which he has presented to us
as i have already said institution building is just as important as are legal judicial and police reform because that is where human rights are applied
i fully support the rapporteur s recommendation regarding the use of the structural funds the cohesion funds and the european agricultural fund for rural development eafrd
i voted in favour of this report which had been substantially strengthened at committee stage through the adoption of all nine amendments i had tabled
these renewable energy sources should take on a dominant role in the field of heating and cooling which currently represents almost of energy consumption in europe
mr president the prosperity and well being of the eu s citizens are based on recognised freedoms the free movement of goods persons capital and services
unfortunately when it comes to free movement of persons the very freedom that would be most beneficial to the new member states we face significant restrictions
as the first part has been rejected i suspect the second and third parts should fall  can you help us on that mr hokmark
in conclusion europe has nothing to gain from this kind of legislation  in fact it runs the risk of getting its feathers torn out !
we therefore support measures that could encourage the use of renewable energy informing users removing administrative barriers providing implementation aid encouraging research and so on
today is st  valentine s day but there is not much evidence of love between the member states of the old and new union
we must take all these approaches  energy policy is top priority and the last few months have shown us just how important it is
mr president mr bartenstein energy dependence is priority number one  the security of the energy supply will be keeping us very busy in future
one can therefore conclude that such strong resistance to the adoption of the directive in its initial form stems from irrational fears verging on xenophobia
mr president ladies and gentlemen i am speaking on behalf of the new italian socialist party and as a member of the committee on development
perhaps the services could look into what has happened because it is unacceptable for outsiders to come in here and film what we are doing
secondly tax concessions and lower vat rates should apply to all activities involving the use exploitation and creation of new sources of renewable energy
we therefore advocate an extended deadline to allow for a trial period and subsequent adaptation to a system that does not exist in portugal
the interest and concern displayed by the rapporteur on the human rights and democracy clause in european union agreements are worthy of commendation
we are looking forward to the proposals which the commission has announced and i hope that we will succeed in our goal on thursday
there is also a commitment to regional cooperation and good neighbourly relations which are very much essential parts of the stabilisation and association process
we in the presidency want to try to ensure that the restrictions that exist and are laid down are applied as little as possible
mr president the commissioner will be relieved that we are getting very close to the end  i am the third to last speaker
in essence this is a reworking of the shadowy bildeberg club to impose the steamroller of globalisation and the rules of the new order
as chairman of the popular orthodox rally in greece i shall encourage all the groups attacked by the directive to engage in full resistance
mr president commissioner ladies and gentlemen i wish to start by congratulating the rapporteur mr agnoletto on the excellent work he has presented
in a world obsessed by short term benefits and security we cannot lower our guard when it comes to defending our universal rights
mr president this has been a very valuable discussion on the human rights clause and on human rights and democracy in general
this was brief but i wanted to say it  i believe that our commissioner has now heard what we wanted to say
mr president with regard to the report by my colleague mr ory i am torn between three feelings satisfaction regret and a wish
of europe s economy and workforce relies on a healthy service sector a sector being slowly strangled by a mindless mass of regulation
does the recent criticism of the court of justice by council president wolfgang schussel have the support of the council as a whole
if so why has council not expressed this view before nor requested the commission to bring forward proposals to change the legal situation
this is what makes the process of the services directive so effective and i am pleased with the compromises that have been reached
mr president ladies and gentlemen the directive we are debating will doubtless be remembered for the tortuous and difficult path it has followed
mr president ladies and gentlemen it probably goes without saying that the adoption of this directive will be a highly important political event
i hope that in this united role we will be able to provoke rapid processes which will restore the normal functions of democracy
i also feel that the creation of an internal market in services is essential in order to increase the eu s competitiveness
parliament will be able to adopt the services directive subject to the necessary adjustments being made to the commission s original draft
drinking water is a topic that is equally problematic and is for that reason best kept outside of the directive s scope
finally i conclude by stressing again that the text that is under examination today is a very balanced and important proposal
mr president i wish to speak briefly on my report on access restrictions to fisheries under the common fisheries policy
the proposed amendment is appropriate and the committee on agriculture and rural development s favourable opinion should be supported by parliament
it is important that the directive helps reduce the administrative burden for service providers who are active in other member states
what does the council intend to do with regard to these member states  or how do you see this problem
the union will be unable to compete successfully on the global market if it is paralysed by fear of internal competition
mr president ladies and gentlemen once again we are addressing a topic that is important for truly creating the internal market
as the workers have been demanding and as we have been calling for from the outset this directive must be rejected
may we ask my fellow members whether they are aware of whose hands they are playing into by their present actions
that unnecessary row could have been avoided but i welcome this belated acceptance of the european parliament s commonsense decision
i am deeply disappointed however that a clause as fundamental as this one remains absent from the agreements on textiles
the directive must be fleshed out in practice  the quality of its enforcement will be decisive in this respect
mr president of course the recognition of borders cannot be made dependent on conditions let me make that absolutely clear
of course this principle would be unable to prevail over all the others because we have controlled and managed it
the next item is the commission statement on the new financial instrument for development in connection with the millennium goals
mr president on a point of order there was a guy up there filming us including when we were signing
mrs rothe s report contributes to the objectives of the european energy policy and i very much welcome it
the text of council regulation ec no contains a number of errors which should be corrected without delay
we shall now resume the debate on the report by mrs evelyne gebhardt on services in the internal market
unfortunately for the lithuanian the proposed directive means that little has changed since the days of the iron curtain
bg mr president mr swoboda i would like to ask you a question  you cited data from and
this is a classic example of the often painfully slow nature of the european decision making process
the eu has succeeded in incorporating a human rights and democracy clause in international agreements with third countries
if the presidency and the commission help to create a better directive then we can really be content
does austria see any answers to the specific problem of access to higher education and if so what
the report by mrs gebhardt on the bolkestein directive has come to plenary today for debate and vote
mr president the amendment is already in the minutes but i shall read it out again anyway
first of all then we must abandon the country of origin principle with all its devastating effects
mr president i should like to make three observations with regard to the human rights clause
it is thus that the free movement of services is provided for and fair competition ensured
the european left rejects the disguised bolkestein directive and calls for amendments limiting its adverse repercussions
i voted against the directive and i wish this statement to be entered in the minutes
mr president the use of special forms of surveillance is a sensitive issue in any country
i would like mrs mcguinness to be given another opportunity to speak on this subject
in closing i would like to thank evelyne gebhard and everyone here including commissioner mccreevy
bg mr president every debate in the european parliament reflects the interests of european citizens
yes mr swoboda i will enquire about this and we will take steps as necessary
we are vehemently opposed to this proposal for a directive aimed at liberalising services
on december the council adopted conclusions on improving openness and transparency in the council
lithuania has now rid itself of communists and we are in the european union
the essence of the amendments which i propose and which are in the text

i would remind you that we currently import hl in wine from south africa which will be imported if this agreement is applied without any import tax
mr president on the turkish question we have this morning heard what i consider to be quite staggering statements from mr verheugen the commissioner responsible for enlargement

nonetheless there are no other roads possible and at the end of the road there will be two states which are each guaranteeing to respect the other

fr i am abstaining on the compromise resolution on aids  the fact that the joint motion for resolution bears my name is an error

mr president i wish to compliment mr schulz not only on the quality of his report but also on his presentation this morning which was excellent

commissioner mr president ladies and gentlemen in introducing my proposal i would like to remind you of the european parliament resolution voted on june
on amendments nos and we accept all of those in principle subject to some rewording and i think the last two replace nos and
in taking such decisions the european parliament violates the spirit of the treaties and i hope there will be governments capable of restoring order

what action does the council intend to take to prevent and avoid attacks of this kind within the territory of the european union
i wish to thank the president in office of the council for his reply  there are two parts to my supplementary question
mr president on behalf of the socialist group i would ask that we not do proceed to the vote on the oral amendment
yes i believe it is ! and i must warmly congratulate our colleague and friend baron crespo on the quality of his work
mr president we are going to have to leave turkey in no doubt about all this  there must be no doublespeak !
today turkey seems to be on a more positive path and we must therefore negotiate without reservations but without closing our eyes
to conclude we hope that the special cooperation which we have established with the ombudsman will continue in the years to come
i plead to all those who want turkey to modernise on the basis of its european traditions to support our amendment
mr president this new round of negotiations poses a question of principle a question of method and a question of content

bg commissioner ladies and gentlemen km of the black sea coast have now been part of the european union s external eastern border for more than two years
to summarise i see some timid signs of recovery  i agree that close monitoring of the situation is needed and that this will allow action where necessary
therefore we as parliament must take our job very seriously over the next few years  we hope that our cooperation with the new commission will be constructive
all of these factors must be taken into account if we are to realize a true policy for food aid and sustainability through the passing of this regulation

there must never never be torture in chile again ! with the forthcoming signature of the eu chile framework agreement president frei will testify to that

it madam president commissioner ladies and gentlemen the crisis that the agricultural sector is going through is extremely serious and is in danger of becoming irreversible
madam president commissioner ladies and gentlemen  in the era of the globalised economy the european union s common commercial policy seems quite natural to us
in conclusion i reiterate my support for this report and i strongly wish for rapid progress on this dossier and quick adoption also by the council

therefore the decision to include certain countries in this liberalisation of visa requirements is based on the merits of each individual country
the european ombudsman has its good and bad points as an institution  the same applies to mr soderman s report
we shall keep on pressing as much as we can for that in the hope that you will be very understanding
now that the agency has taken its first positive steps we must define its future role and its pace of development
in that regard we would need to be very careful and not over regulate and price ourselves out of the market
mr president i think that mr escudero s report has a certain value and i ask him to accept my congratulations
this means that there should be no unnecessary obstacles no incentives to compromise our security for the sake of procedural rules

once again we condemn the situation but we also wish to condemn the failure to put these measures into practice

mr president commissioner since we cannot reject the directive on chocolate which is as it stands unacceptable parliament is duty bound at the very least to improve it
in my opinion the pending directive will make it even easier for producers of quality chocolate to set themselves clearly apart from the others if they so wish
the next item is the commission communication additional commission contribution to the igc on institutional reform qualified majority for taxation and social security aspects of the internal market
subject community initiative leader the community initiative leader was planned as a pilot programme to enable the commission to introduce innovations in development practices in sensitive agricultural regions
mr president the industry committee after much discussion and serious consideration is overwhelmingly opposed to the commission s proposed ceilings and this is across all groups and nationalities
what is more it should not be the case that one commissioner sets himself up as some sort of supreme commissioner who can then dictate to the other
mr president madam vice president i wanted to reply to my bavarian colleague but he has left the chamber  so i shall say it for the record
therefore as i have said i do not think the picture is black and white there is a full spectrum of different colours from warm to cold shades
mr president this discussion has clearly shown that the key word is solidarity  i should like to thank a number of members for their words of thanks
mr president of the commission please tell mr liikanen from us that he must do his homework ! we need a sound tourism policy for the union
the commission supports amendment no in principle and supports the following amendments amendments nos and  the commission does not support the following amendments amendments nos and
this is the political message which we must send  being european is a positive thing  it adds to what we already have as national citizens
will the commission agree to submit the agreement on china s wto accession to this parliament s assent even if the igc has not yet been concluded
mr president mr blokland ladies and gentlemen waste management is a complex task  this is confirmed yet again by our discussions and the particularly powerful lobbying
finally additional policy for example in the field of volatile solvents used in paints and varnishes as well as in car spraying will continue to be necessary
mr president consumer protection is our prime concern  the issue of the directive on the production and sale of chocolate is thus just as important
madam president as draftsman of the opinion of the committee on employment and social affairs i will mainly focus on the issue of social fundamental rights
finally madam president it is essential for the european union to accede to the european convention on human rights for strasbourg must become stronger not weaker
i should like to say that a charter of fundamental rights is both welcome and essential provided it does not fall into the following three traps
there is no doubt that the kingdom of morocco is currently occupying the western sahara and this territory is currently undergoing a process of self determination
the commission s communication on the subject implies that the intention is to explain the consequences of the igc to the public opinion of the fifteen

i want to come to the issue which mr davies has addressed namely where we should start from  with what targets are we to start
i hope that the message of dialogue the message of talking about the future not only about the past will also be put across in moscow
can we count on your commission to submit suitable proposals to parliament in the near future on preparing turkey for accession to the eu
we are also concerned president prodi at the lack of proposals concerning the tourism sector a sector in which so many of our citizens work
neither the brussels commission nor the european parliament have any desire to act or even clearly name the parties responsible for these disastrous ecological developments
furthermore we intend to produce a communication on this subject on the pyrenees and the alps before the end of the year proposing concrete solutions
the truth is that there is currently no such alternative  therefore the first thing we have to do is suitably develop the corresponding routes
mr president the ffh directive is an issue which has concerned us for some time now and we are currently experiencing a few teething problems
we are far from striking a proper balance between social and economic interests  i would therefore warmly recommend the amendments tabled by my group
thank you mr prodi for your presentation and your documentation  congratulations on using the internet for the general public a very good idea
fr the european parliament has today expressed its opinion of the proposed directive on the technical roadside inspection of the roadworthiness of commercial vehicles
another amendment regarding a more far reaching alternative amendment no stipulates that the echr as well these social international standards should be acceded to
madam president as draftsman of the opinion of the committee on women s rights and equal opportunities i would like to answer two questions
madam president no doubt the council would like to hear the opinion of the political groups which seems to me to be very healthy
i therefore hope madam president that tomorrow s vote will support the rapporteurs good work with a massive vote in favour of this report
as on other occasions such as the intergovernmental conference of this parliament must offer the commission its support in order to monitor information activities
commissioner i am convinced that the committee on budgets will be delighted to read this information as soon as they are provided with it
however as you well know we clearly have problems with one of the countries involved with regard to the railway between oloron and canfranc
mr president commissioner i have of course nothing against the principle of the directive  it is an important instrument for future environmental policy
i ask the house to come to a similar decision and vote tomorrow against waiving mr korakas immunity  thank you for your attention
the next item is the council and commission statements on the situation of the world financial system and its consequences on the european markets
mr president it has taken us twenty five years to come to the point of a common position which represents a real compromise
mr president commissioner genetically modified organisms and mad cow disease were not enough to temper the enthusiasm of those involved in food manipulation
ensuring fundamental human rights is the best of intentions but a charter for litigation and bureaucracy is surely another road to another hell
like you mr clegg i believe that china s accession to the wto whenever it takes place is a matter of crucial importance
finally we condemn the attitude of the european union which by sitting squarely on the fence is basically supporting israel s barbaric behaviour
without going into the details of the motion for a resolution tabled by mr rubig i wish to refer to two very specific issues
it was and still is the permanent nightmare that will always mark the defeat for those who dreamed of global sovereignty
in writing  de increasingly frequently in the modern world consumers come into contact with different substances and sometimes also hazardous substances
the lack of motivation amongst excellent civil servants is serious  we must take action and the example should come from above
these are the reasons why ladies and gentlemen i supported the proposed directive on the technical roadside inspection of commercial vehicles today
my second question is does the instrument that you are proposing in the area of environmental taxation provide for qualified majority voting
the success rate of leader i in greece also proved satisfactory in view of the programme s innovative and even handed approach
as you have pointed out very well the number of deaths on european roads caused by excessive alcohol consumption has risen to
et ladies and gentlemen thank you for your clear message that russia must not treat estonia as its province or constituent republic
mr president my group would like to welcome the annual legislative programme  however we have some concerns about the process
these are the gaps we need to plug  let us do it in the new medium term social action programme
i would like to start by thanking the commissioner for his kind answer although i find it to be completely insufficient
amongst other things in order to ban heavy transport the first thing we need is an alternative route for heavy transport
the commission cannot accept amendment no  it would remove an essential obligation for member states regularly to update emission inventories
i am going to focus essentially on the most controversial aspect of the directive which is the issue of the objectives
russia has not given up its designs on the baltic states but is attempting to use the divide and rule principle
others took the form of private takeovers such as the purchase of the investment bank merrill lynch by bank of america
the next item is the continuation of the debate on the european commission s annual legislative programme for the year
mr president the report you have presented is ambitious and complex and i will only touch on a few points
just to repeat what my colleague poul nielson stated yesterday the commission s position on the amendments is as follows
commissioner i have some very simple questions for you which require just a yes or no answer in each case
does the commission commit itself to formally consulting the secretary general of the united nations  yes or no commissioner
as they deal with the same subject questions nos and will be taken together at the request of the commission
thank you very much for pointing that out  we will try and make sure it is corrected by tomorrow
i would therefore suggest that only those members who vote against strasbourg should still be allowed to use parliamentary cars
a less appropriate idea is to include social provisions in this text  this is not the place for these
response of the european union to the deteriorating situation in the east of the democratic republic of congo vote
what has the reform of the commission to do with the internal market  the answer is a lot

mr president firstly i would very much like to congratulate mrs ayuso on the excellent work she has done
let us proceed with the order of the day and put chocolate to its intended use namely enjoyment

what provisions will be taken to ensure that ngos enjoy effective access to union funding
pursuant to rule of the rules of procedure i have received seven motions for resolution
mr president the internal reform of the commission has begun  we welcome that !
since you have asked the state which has opposed it until now is france
the problem is obviously that drugs produce states which clearly limit drivers response capacities
commissioner waste management in europe must undergo complete reform as a matter of urgency
support the purvis amendments and the united nations gothenburg table of national emission ceilings
as to galileo it will continue to receive of its funding from the community
if you would allow me to make a point of order
as a final remark i would like to thank mrs myller the rapporteur
situation of the world financial system and its consequences on the european markets debate
explanations of vote recommendation for second reading of the fernandez martin report a
however the concrete solutions must clearly be accepted by the member states

fr mr president mr jouyet commissioner i would like to begin by thanking mr jouyet for being available and for the great competence he displays in all areas
therefore let us not always use the issue of control in order to be highly restrictive at times for some decisions do not always need to be made
russia is the eu s third biggest trading partner accounting for half a trillion dollars in european goods  can we afford to risk that kind of relationship
sixth it makes clear that the black sea area needs much more attention and involvement from the eu and therefore that it requires more than a simply synergy
member of the commission  madam president i appreciated the exchange of views on the report which testify the commitment of parliament to the cause of human rights
this follow up should focus on actions by the political and electoral authorities concerned and on an active role for civil society and democracy promotion including electoral reform
mr president i also want to express my gratitude and satisfaction that the parliament is today debating this report on an initiative which came from mr napolitano himself
this is why mr president ladies and gentlemen i agree more with the text of the alternative resolution tabled by mr ribeiro castro which shall have my vote
the commission should adopt a dynamic approach towards the criteria on admissibility and the results indicators should be established on the basis of poverty reduction objectives being met
no the obstacle lies in europe s disunity  we are not yet as able as we might wish to speak with one voice  that must change
what we are discussing here then is not about short term necessity  it is about how we can guarantee humane social development for the long term
i think that mr de rossa is proposing that commissioner mccreevy be offered a subscription to the guardian  the president s office will look into it
these are two fundamental principles that are absent here and i hope that these will be taken into account in the reform of the common fisheries policy
in the context of the review in the car labelling directive we will take into account the recommendations made by parliament in the field of consumer information
the great variety and number of european union human rights dialogues and consultations with third countries which moreover are steadily increasing make any global evaluation very arduous
mr president i am sorry that because my train was delayed i have only just arrived and have not therefore been able to hear the previous debate
the strange thing about the swiebel report is that it contains a detailed account of the reasons why the resolution that it is proposing should be rejected
ga mr president in general i am in favour of this budgetary support for developing countries but to be honest i am somewhat doubtful about its effectiveness
the situation we face here in europe is less acute and member states do not at this point consider that a us style plan is needed
how should we respond to this economic slowdown  the best answer is to make use of all the policy instruments we have at our disposal
in each of these policy areas our actions will be more efficient and effective if we coordinate them at the euro area and european union level
application of directive ec on the right of eu citizens and their family members to move and reside freely within the territory of the member states
everything now depends on eu actions not just reactions  no business as usual entails taking concrete steps because russia will only understand if we act
i would like to welcome mr olexander moroz president of the verjovna rada the ukrainian parliament who is in the gallery and the delegation accompanying him
not addressing these realities with all the power and authority of the eu makes us share responsibility for the brutal violation of human rights in russia
the impact on the actual dialogue and on relations with third countries should be carefully weighed to avoid depriving the european union of an effective instrument
in conclusion i trust that the members will reflect on the points i have made and that there will be broad consensus in tomorrow s votes
sire grant us the freedom to vote ! and remember the ceterum censeo there is no democracy without transparency and voting that is open and fair
the next item is the report by charles goerens on behalf of the committee on development on the future of eu budget support to developing countries
i believe that the eu must retain conditionality as a basis for budget support  this will help guarantee respect for human rights in developing countries
mr president commissioner padraig flynn and i are of course at the disposal of honourable members to reply to any questions they would like to ask
what are the main measures that have been announced apart from a welcome but insufficient increase of eib loans to small and medium sized enterprises
this jeopardises the entire credibility of the common fisheries policy and its own future as such something that should not be assumed before the reform
this approach towards achieving the g target is in our view the most cost effective combination of options and we will thus propose legislation accordingly
two amendments were accepted by president medvedev in particular one point on the final status which we understand he did not want in the text
finally we have agreed on the fact that all meetings on the partnership agreement should be postponed until the russians withdraw to their previous positions
finally thirdly the its has a go at turkey in a tirade against the party of messrs erdogan and gul that singularly lacks any basis
that is hardly a matter for the agenda  it should be raised at another time  we will however take note of your comments
we can put behind us for good the colonial era which was marked by the appropriation of entire continents by the old european colonial powers
but we have a problem now and changing the rules after the problem has arisen is not going to help us with that problem
hence i hope the commission can show sensitivity to what are clearly major concerns for the fishing industry and our own committee on fisheries
the message of ambivalence will not be lost on moscow  it is hardly shaking in its boots over the divided mutterings of europe
third it highlights the weak position of europe due to increasing energy dependence on russia and the delay in ratification of the lisbon treaty
in my view given the present situation it is essential for the european union to send a peacekeeping and monitoring mission to south ossetia
but i says to them they want to bring that europe much closer to our citizens so that s all right isn t it
the financial sector has been most severely affected as nervousness among banks has caused liquidity to dry up in the interbank lending market
mr president georgia is not a simple episode in international politics  it is the beginning of a chain reaction with important consequences
russia s actions in georgia are regrettable dangerous in the context of regional and european stability and implicitly unacceptable by the international community
the eu efforts to ensure its energy security should also be increased to the maximum including by the development of the nabucco project
i will just clarify for the house that you are proposing that north korea be taken in the second part session this month
i understand that the document has not been withdrawn  it will be made available in all languages to colleagues in the house
just for confirmation according to the final draft agenda the vote is not tomorrow as mr mendez de vigo implied but on wednesday
i agree with the council that the times of total deregulation are over  neither the markets nor industry can self regulate
in writing  ro the eu is not entitled to allow the georgian scenario to repeat in other conflict regions as well
mr  president of the european parliament mr  president of the council of the european union mrs  commissioner dear colleagues
in writing  ro the great gain of today s extraordinary meeting of the european council is the unity of member states
finally cross border cooperation is also an essential element in european construction and we are pleased that the napolitano report recognises this
yes mr maccormick because according to my information the plenum of this parliament has decided that the vote will take place tomorrow
mr president i want to begin by thanking my colleague mrs swiebel for the sterling work she has done on this report
mr president i wish to thank the rapporteur for highlighting some of the main concerns raised by the commission s proposal
president saakashvili cannot have believed that military intervention would evoke no response from russia  equally russia s reaction was disproportionate
europe should convene a trans caucasian peace conference bringing together all sides in the search for the settlement of unresolved conflicts
first it indicates russia s military comeback which will have to be reflected in the new european security strategy under preparation
we also consider it essential to increase the role of interparliamentary assemblies and interparliamentary delegations in human rights dialogues and consultations
finally i repeat this report covers those points and i thank the rapporteur once more for her high standard of teamwork
i would appeal for sanity and responsibility in order to find a solution to a problem we have had for decades
the common manual on border control should be revised to include the common standards and to take account of best practice
commissioner minister jouyet my group is expecting you to take rapid rational and successful action and to do so now
i am sorry  i interrupted mrs kauppi and i interrupted mrs beres  i am generally fair mr purvis
es mr president i will try to be very clear given the wide variety of opinions expressed from my bench
that brings me to the end of my quick resume of what has been a lengthy but extremely important debate
you are too late to change today s agenda  that should have been notified by p m  today
mr president every day in spain we see a horrendous tragedy involving people who come looking for a better life
we must make great demands of ourselves in the eu now that we are making demands of the candidate countries
i thank the president of the commission and commissioner flynn for their replies and their readiness to answer members questions
the draft report proposes various important areas of work are two of which i should like to comment on
the russians will recognise the consequences of our taking resolute action and not simply being driven by their agenda
first of all all decisions should be based upon compliance with georgia s territorial integrity and the international law
in writing  pl i believe great caution should be exercised when assessing the conflict between russia and georgia
i do not want to conclude without mentioning with satisfactory coverage of women s rights within this report  !
in writing  pl i should like to draw the attention of the house to the following issues
let me again express my gratitude to the rapporteur and the committee for their work on this proposal
the european council has just ended but minister bernard kouchner will undoubtedly tell us all about it himself
the situation will not be resolved by strong language and gestures but by rational negotiations around the table

other forms of offences where there are factual indications that a criminal organisation or serious crimes are involved
this discrimination against persons with disabilities requires forthright dialogue regardless of the economics between the eu and china
i voted in favour of adopting the joint motion for a resolution on the situation in georgia
de that is how the compromise would be worded and both amendments and would then be covered

fifth it demonstrates that international legality needs to be strengthened both in concept and in respect
for ensuring stability in the black sea region three key principles should guide the eu action

this is a test of the credibility of the european union s human rights standards

such outrageous actions violate the natural right to property and therefore should be condemned
community strategy to reduce co emissions from passenger cars and light commercial vehicles debate
that matter should and will be referred to the conference of presidents

mr president i would ask that the damage sustained by the parliament building as a result of yesterday s demonstration be paid for by those who caused it
it is a shame of course that the agreement was accepted by the council without having consulted the european parliament which represents the interests of the european people
the current postal directive ec as amended by directive ec does not impose a uniform tariff but requires a minimum frequency of delivery of five days a week

thirdly the veterinary and phytosanitary standards  the negotiations have been completed  but certain matters relating to the bse situation still remain to be sorted out
we are however opposed to proposals in the report that interfere in the member states areas of competence for example that of how the police are organised
secondly we must reconsider the pipeline situation in europe  we are particularly vulnerable since most gas is supplied via ukraine  are there any possible alternatives
madam president the methods being employed to reform the sugar market run counter to the strategic goals of the eu and of the common agricultural policy
with regard to the recently introduced deregulation in the united kingdom does the commissioner have any plans to monitor that or any comments to make upon it
thus this evening we are closing the debate on two very important directives which no doubt will improve the environment and protect the health of european citizens
vice president of the commission  madam president at president barroso s request i am addressing the house here today on the subject of the hungarian constitution
fourthly in the field of competition the negotiations have also been completed and the agreement will be sent to the council in the next few weeks
mr president the report by our dear colleague siegbert alber which we are debating this evening is worthy of our special attention for two principle reasons
as for the fires in sumatra it was said that the early warning system did not work  i do not understand your question mr telkamper
it has become clear in the various discussions in committee however that this strategy cannot develop without agreements with the usa the russian federation and china
i voted in favour of this report which forms part of the broader question of the development of the eu s external relations concerning aviation policy
mr president ladies and gentlemen energy resources are among the fundamental economic and production factors ensuring the competitiveness of an economy and the wellbeing of people
the rapporteur is trying with his proposals to delay the repercussions somewhat  unfortunately a quick or a slower death for the sugar industry

for this reason we must stipulate in this directive that an effective financing system is necessary for the natura network  i therefore support this directive

i now want to listen to what you parliamentarians have to say in order to understand the position of the european parliament on this matter

in any case mr hindley if the european parliament can come up with a better method we will be quite prepared to accept it
mr president i am speaking in support of this agreement on behalf of the committee on external economic relations whose members supported it unanimously
